# Solana Extension for MoneyMoney
This extension fetches the amount of privately held Solana addresses via the official main-api of the Solana blockchain project. It then requests the current value in EUR from cryptocompare.com and displays the value of the supplied addresses as securities.

This can be used to track your cold storage.
